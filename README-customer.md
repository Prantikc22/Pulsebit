# Welcome to Pulsebit Self-Hosted Analytics!

Thank you for purchasing Pulsebit. This guide will help you deploy Pulsebit on your own VPS or server with a single script.

## üöÄ One-Click Setup (Recommended)
1. **Upload or copy the `setup.sh` script to your VPS.**
2. **Run the script:**
   ```sh
   bash setup.sh
   ```
   This will:
   - Install Docker and Docker Compose (if missing)
   - Clone the latest Pulsebit code
   - Set up your environment file
   - Build and start Pulsebit and Postgres

3. **Edit your `.env` file** (required!) and set a secure `APP_SECRET`.
4. **Visit** `http://<your-vps-ip>:3000` to access Pulsebit.

  - The full `/umami` directory (with Dockerfile, docker-compose.yml, setup.sh, etc.)
  - `.env.example` template
  - This README

## üñ±Ô∏è What about the "button"?
- If you use a customer portal, you can provide a "Deploy to VPS" or "Download Self-Host Package" button.

## üåç Accessing Pulsebit from the Internet (Custom Domain)

1. **Point your domain to your VPS/server IP:**
   - Log in to your domain registrar (GoDaddy, Namecheap, Cloudflare, etc).
   - Create an "A" record for your domain (e.g., `analytics.yourdomain.com`) pointing to your VPS public IP.
2. **(Optional but recommended) Set up HTTPS:**
   - Use a reverse proxy like Nginx or Caddy on your VPS to proxy requests to Pulsebit (port 3000) and handle SSL certificates (Let‚Äôs Encrypt).
   - Example Nginx config is available in `README-docker.md`.
3. **Open firewall ports:**
   - Make sure port 80 (HTTP) and 443 (HTTPS) are open on your VPS.
   - If you want to use Pulsebit directly (not behind a proxy), open port 3000 as well (not recommended for production).
4. **Access Pulsebit:**
   - Visit `https://analytics.yourdomain.com` (or your chosen subdomain) in your browser.
